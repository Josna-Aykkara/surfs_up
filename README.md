## Summary

To summarize, it can be concluded that Hawaii is an excellent place to open up the business venture based on the temperature data. The temperatures on an average do not fluctuate drastically. The average temperatures were of about 74.94 degrees in summer and about 71.04 degrees during winter season. As a result, there would be continuous constant business year round. 


We should run additional queries to perform to gather more weather data to carry out the analysis effectively and accurately. There would be different factors other than temperature that would affect the success of the business venture. 

•**Rain Occurrence** – As the rain occurrence and magnitude should also be considered for the analysis, as it acts as a factor that would directly affect sales at the store. The clients would be hesitant to go to the beach to surf or have an ice cream on such days. 
•**Tsunami or Storm probability** – Data should also be collected on the storm or Tsunami probability based on the location of the store, as it’s near the beach. The storm data is more important to estimate the possible safety precautions to be taken and opting for a safer location for the store.
